# FFmpegAudioDecoderCpp

A simple C++ wrapper for FFmpeg v4.1 Audio Decoding API which is in C.

This code is created based on the FFmpeg code example doc/examples/decode_audio.c, with modifications so that it creates stereo output at the specified sample rate, along with additional error messages.

I'm not very good at C, in fact I'm a bit uncomfortable with it. But I hope this repo becomes useful for other C++ programmers who struggles to find a thorough example from the offical FFmpeg docs.

This repo intends to serve as a code example. This code was taken out of another project, where it proved to decode audio files. However, this repo isn't being actively maintained.
